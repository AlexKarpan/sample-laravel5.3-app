## Notes

- Added a console command to add users (administrators in the current setup)
- Added the default Laravel auth and routes: the register routes are active, although they should be disabled in a real app
- Slightly updated the autogenerated admin CRUD pages
- Made schedule form suggest other dates if possible
- Ignored the design issues
- Kept the default error messages
- Added some basic tests
